\subsubsection{Artist Created:}
\label{sec:art}
This technique works not by creating the clouds at run time but instead creates the clouds as models and loads them into the game when needed.
\citet{NWang04} describes a version of this which allows artists to create boxes in 3DS Max in which a plug-in will then generate clouds inside the box.
She explained how this method was used when creating Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight (\citeyear{MFS03}).
A similar method can be used in the CryEngine 3 SDK (\citeyear{Crytek13}) which allows the user to alter the properties of the clouds created in real-time within the editor. 
This method can create very realistic looking clouds but doesn't allow for realistic movement or generation.
