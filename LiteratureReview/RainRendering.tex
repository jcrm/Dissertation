\subsection{Rain Rendering:}
“Rain is an extremely complex natural atmospheric phenomenon” \citep*{APuig-Centelles09}.
\citet*{APuig-Centelles09} describe two main techniques for rendering rain to a scene scrolling textures where a texture the size of the screen scrolls in the direction of the rain, and a particle system where each rain drop is represented as a particle in the system.
\citet{STariq07} writes “animating rain using a particle system is more useful for realistic looking rain with lots of behaviour (like changing wind).”
Whereas \citet*{APuig-Centelles09} sates texture scrolling “is faster than particle systems, but it does not allow interaction between rain and the environment.”
