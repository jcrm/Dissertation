\subsubsection{Multiple scattering:}
\label{sec:multiple}
“Multiple scattering models are more physically accurate, but must account for scattering in all directions … and therefore are much more complicated and expensive to evaluate” \citep{MHarris01}.
\citet{HarrisEtAl03} uses a version of multiple scattering which is called multiple forward scattering, this differs from the original by instead of calculating scattering in all directions it calculates scattering in the forward direction only.
This means the algorithm is less computationally heavy. \citet*{Fedkiw01} describe the multiple scattering of light as necessary for objects made from water vapour, which clouds are.
