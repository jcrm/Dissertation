\subsubsection{Volume Rendering:}
\label{sec:vr}

Volume rendering is the process of converting a 3D set of data and rendering to the screen.
There are two types of volume rendering ray-casting, and slice-based.
This section will look at the first type of volume rendering.
This type of ray casting is done by drawing a ray from the eye position through the 3D object and then calculating the colour of the object by blending the data found whilst iterating through the ray.
Figure \ref{fig:ray_casting2} shows an example of rays being caste from the camera position through the 3D volume.
