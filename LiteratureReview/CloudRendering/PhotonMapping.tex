\subsubsection{Photon Mapping:}
“Photon mapping is a variation of pure Monte Carlo ray tracing in which photons (particles of radiant energy) are traced through a scene” (\citet{Jensen96}, cited in \citet{MHarris03}).
\citet{MHarris03} describes the process of photon mapping as storing position, incoming direction, and radiance of each photon landing on a nonspecular surface that has been traced from the light source.
\citet*{Fedkiw01} use photon mapping when rendering smoke and describe the process as a two pass algorithm, one where a volume photon map is built and the second as a rendering pass using a forward ray marching algorithm.
