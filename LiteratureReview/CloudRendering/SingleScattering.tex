\subsubsection{Single Scattering:}
\label{sec:single}
\citet*{MHarris01} describe single scattering as a model that simulates scattering in a single direction that is usually the direction leading to the point of view.
There are debates concerning whether or not this type of rendering is detailed enough for rendering clouds.
\citet{Miyazaki01} states the main topic of his model is the cloud shapes so using single scattering is enough to check the shape of the cloud.
\citet{CBohren87} describes single scattering as insufficient when describing common observations.
Due to this being a simpler and less computational heavy method of rendering clouds compared to other methods this process could be best for cloud generated using a number of complex equations.
