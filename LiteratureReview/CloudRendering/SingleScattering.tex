\subsubsection{Single Scattering:}
\citet*{MHarris01} describe single scattering as a model that simulates scattering in a single direction that is usually the direction leading to the point of view.
There are debates whether or not this type of rendering is detailed enough for rendering clouds.
\citet{Miyazaki01} states the main topic of his model is the cloud shapes so using single scattering is enough to check the shape of the cloud.
\citet{CBohren87} describes single scattering as insufficient when describing common observations.
