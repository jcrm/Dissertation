\subsection{Background:}
Weather plays a huge impact to the how a game feels, as \citet{Barton08} wrote about how "It was a dark and stormy night" not only sets the time and weather of the scene but also sets the tone. \citet{NWang04} agrees by saying that one of the most fascinating parts of a scene could be the clouds. An example of this is the game Tomb Raider (\citeyear{TombRaider13}) which at numerous points in the game the user can see a vast sky full of clouds.
