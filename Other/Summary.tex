\section{Summary}
This project will look into how the amount of rain produced in a game can be proportional to the size of real time simulated clouds. This will be done by using fluid dynamic equations to simulate cloud growth which will be run on the GPU using CUDA and rendered to the scenes using DirectX 11 and C++. 

There has been a lot of research into generating cloud at real time or rendering clouds but not in having the rain dependent on the clouds. Hopefully this project, in particular the application, will show that it is possible to create a real time cloud simulation with added rain effects. If the simulation can run efficiently enough and still look visually realistic then variations of the model could be used in games, especially open world games, as a form of more realistic weather.  \textsl{}
