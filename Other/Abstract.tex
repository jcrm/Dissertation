This project will look at simulating and rendering clouds in real time focusing on if it is possible to generate a particular amount of rain depending on the size of the clouds.
To show this an application will be created using C++ and DirectX 11 to create and render the scene.
While CUDA will be used to simulate the cloud growth on the GPU.  The scene will consist of an uneven terrain and a cloud layer all shown in 3D. 

This application will then be evaluated using two methods. The first, a visual comparison at different time steps showing the growth of clouds, the rain being created, and the final deformation of the clouds.
The second method of evaluation will be to test the efficiency of the model and to see if it could work effectively in an application such as a game. 
The expected outcome is for it to be possible to generate rain proportional to the size of the cloud. The main focus will be getting it to run in real time and look visually realistic.
