\subsection{Risk Analysis:}
There aren't that many risks when developing the application except for the fact that the simulation of clouds might not be able to be rendered in real time.
Another risk would be not finding the correct moment in the clouds life cycle in which to start and finish generating the rain.
To combat this a 2D simulation will be created first which will be used to test different moments of the clouds diffusion for the right moment to start generating rain.
