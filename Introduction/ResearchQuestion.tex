\subsection{Research Question:}
There are two aims of the project, the first is to create clouds in real time using fluid dynamic equations.
The second is to see if the amount of rain created in a scene can be proportional to the size of the clouds created.
These two aims lead to the research question:
\clearpage
\textit{\textbf{Can the amount of Precipitation generated in a game be proportional to the size of visually realistic simulated clouds generated in real-time using fluid dynamic equations?
}}

To answer this question a number of objectives will be completed including research into fluid dynamic equations and their use in creating and moving clouds around a 3D space.
To show the creation of the clouds a 3D application will be created.
This application will as well as showing the creation of clouds at real time show the clouds moving and dissipating, and rain being created when the clouds reach certain sizes.

The fluid dynamic equations will be optimized so that the clouds can run as smoothly as possible whilst still looking realistic.
This leads on to the final application being analysed visually to see if the clouds move and grow over time whilst raining once reaching articular sizes.
